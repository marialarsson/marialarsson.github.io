  <h1> Swirled Branches </h1>

  <p> A swirled structure out of tree branches from broadleaved forest in Japan
    is permanently exhibited at <a><href="https://www.miraikan.jst.go.jp/en/exhibitions/future/digitallynatural/">Miraikan</a> (National Musieum of Emerging Science and Innovation).</p>
  <p> The work is described as follows:</p>
  <p><i> Can We Build a Structure from Irregular Branches?
    This sculpture demonstrates "tekizai-tekisyo" (right material in the right place)
    out of branches from broadleaf forest thinning.
    While commercial products rely on identical standardized parts,
    a little computing power lets the raw materials be as they are.</i></p>

  <p> The left picture is a screenshot of the computer model of the structure before fabrication.
    An abundant number of branches were individually 3D-scanned.
    Then an algorithm selects the best fitting branch for each position in the structure.
    The right picture is a photograph of the fabricated structure. The branches are connected by CNC-milled cross-lap joints.
